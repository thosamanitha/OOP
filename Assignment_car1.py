# Task1: Creating a Car Template
A car is described by its color, max_speed, acceleration and tyre_friction.

Coding Guidelines:

In case of invalid data during the creation of car. Your code should raise ValueError as mentioned in the below code sample
Your code is expected to behave as below

>>> from car import Car  
>>> car = Car(color="Red", max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.acceleration  
10  
>>> car.tyre_friction  
3  
>>> car.max_speed  
250  
>>> car.color  
Red  

>>> from car import Car  
>>> car = Car(color="Red", max_speed=-250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
ValueError: Invalid value for max_speed  

# Task2: Starting a Car
Starting a car should start the engine which will enable the car to accelerate.

>>> from car import Car  
>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.start_engine()  
>>> car.is_engine_started
True

# Task3: Display car speed
As the cars move there should be an attribute to know car’s current speed.

When a new car is created it should be at rest

>>> from car import Car  
>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.current_speed  
0  

# Task4: Increasing the speed
Car Behavior:

On acceleration car speed should increase. Every time the car accelerates its speed should increase by the value of acceleration
Car can accelerate only when the engine is on
Any car cannot accelerate more than its max_speed
Your code is expected to behave as below

>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.start_engine()  
>>> car.accelerate()  
>>> car.current_speed  
10  
>>> car.accelerate()  
>>> car.current_speed  
20
...
...
...
>>> car.current_speed
250
>>> car.accelerate()  
>>> car.current_speed
250

>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.accelerate()  
Start the engine to accelerate  

# Task5: Applying Brake
Behaviour

Decreases the car speed by tyre_friction value
>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.start_engine()  
>>> car.accelerate()  
>>> car.current_sped  
10  
>>> car.apply_brakes()  
>>> car.current_sped  
7  

# Task6: Sound Horn
Behavior

A car should be in start state to sound horn.
>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.start_engine()  
>>> car.sound_horn()  
"Beep Beep"  

>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.sound_horn() # Prints
Start the engine to sound_horn  

# Task7: Stop Car Engine
Behavior

A car engine should be stopped
>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.start_engine()  
>>> car.is_engine_started
True
>>> car.stop_engine()  
>>> car.is_engine_started
False

#Task8: Applying Encapsulation
By binding related attributes & methods as a class we have achieved encapsulation to an extent
Now add safe access to all the attributes by making them protected attributes and adding getters
>>> car = Car(max_speed=250, acceleration=10, tyre_friction=3)  
>>> car.current_speed  # call to getter method
0  
>>> car.start_engine()  
>>> car.accelerate()
>>> car.current_speed  # call to getter method
10  
>>> car.current_speed = 10  
AttributeError: can't set attribute
